 # The handwritting Machine learning (ML)
 
 In this playground, I used my ML model for handwritten letter recognizing.
 
 ## Maybe you don't know ML?
 
 "Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms [...] to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
 
 Basically, ML is a simple AI program that learns itself with a specific pattern. The big difference between ML and real AI is that ML learns once in training, than never again.
 
 about this Model:
 - 20 epoches
 - 32 filters
 - 2 Dropouts
 - input: 28x28px images
 
 ## How I trained:
 
 Create ML needs a lot of time, because it shows each image while it is trained. This makes it very slow. Not good.
 On the otherside Keras is console based, so it is really fast. The problem is that it is not easy to use.
 
 ## About the dataset:
 
 The emnist dataset is an extended version of the mnist dataset. The letter version of emnist provides 103k images in total, 88k for training and 14.8k for testing.
 
 - Note:
 Your task is to add the ML and run it.
